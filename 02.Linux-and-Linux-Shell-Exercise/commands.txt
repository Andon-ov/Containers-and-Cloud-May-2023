                                    2> /dev/null: Redirects any error messages generated during the search to /dev/null, effectively suppressing them.

cat file 1 > /dev/null 2>&1         ->  executes the 'cat' command to display the contents of "file", 
                                    but both the 'output' and any 'error messages' are redirected
